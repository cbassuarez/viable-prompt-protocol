      "body": "1. Goals  \nThe primary goal is to empirically evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and safety of a code-assistant LLM embedded in an IDE. The protocol aims to measure the model’s impact on developer productivity, code quality, and user trust, while identifying potential failure modes and security risks.\n\n2. Threat model & attack surfaces  \n- Threat model includes both inadvertent and adversarial misuse by users, as well as external attacks exploiting the LLM’s outputs.\n- Attack surfaces:\n  - Malicious code suggestions (e.g., introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors).\n  - Leakage of sensitive information from training data.\n  - Prompt injection via user input or codebase artifacts.\n  - Manipulation of code explanations or refactoring suggestions to mislead users.\n  - Abuse of IDE integrations (e.g., auto-execution of unsafe code).\n\n3. Task suite design  \n- Curate a diverse set of programming tasks reflecting real-world developer workflows:\n  - Code completion for partially written functions/classes.\n  - Automated refactoring of legacy or poorly structured code.\n  - Generation of code explanations and documentation.\n  - Bug identification and remediation.\n  - Security-focused tasks (e.g., detecting or avoiding vulnerable patterns).\n- Tasks should span multiple languages and frameworks relevant to the IDE’s user base.\n- Include both synthetic benchmarks and anonymized, permissioned real-world code snippets.\n- Assign tasks to both human developers (with and without LLM assistance) and the LLM alone for comparison.\n\n4. Metrics & reporting  \n- Quantitative metrics:\n  - Task completion time and success rate.\n  - Code quality (linting, test pass rates, static analysis scores).\n  - Security metrics (e.g., number of vulnerabilities introduced or mitigated).\n  - User intervention rate (edits/reverts to LLM suggestions).\n- Qualitative metrics:\n  - User satisfaction and trust (survey-based).\n  - Perceived helpfulness and clarity of explanations.\n- Reporting:\n  - Aggregate results by task type, language, and user experience level.\n  - Document all observed failure cases and security incidents.\n  - Provide reproducible scripts and anonymized datasets for external validation.",
