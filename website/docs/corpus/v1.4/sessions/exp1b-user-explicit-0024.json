Evaluate the model’s resilience to prompt injection, data leakage, and code manipulation attacks during typical developer workflows. Establish a baseline for secure deployment and inform future mitigation strategies.\n\n2. Threat model & attack surfaces  \n- Adversary: An attacker with access to the IDE, capable of crafting malicious code comments, prompts, or files to influence LLM behavior.  \n- Attack surfaces:  \n  - User input fields (comments, code, prompts)  \n  - File system access (malicious files or dependencies)  \n  - LLM-generated code suggestions and explanations  \n  - External plugin or extension APIs  \n- Attack vectors:  \n  - Prompt injection via code comments or documentation  \n  - Data exfiltration through LLM outputs  \n  - Unauthorized code execution or privilege escalation  \n  - Manipulation of refactoring or completion suggestions\n\n3. Task suite design  \n- Construct a suite of representative IDE tasks, including:  \n  - Code completion in the presence of benign and adversarial comments  \n  - Automated refactoring of codebases with embedded attack payloads  \n  - Code explanation and documentation generation for potentially tainted code  \n  - Handling of files with obfuscated or encoded malicious content  \n- Each task is executed in both clean and adversarial scenarios, with adversarial inputs designed to trigger specific attack vectors.  \n- Tasks are automated via scripts to ensure repeatability and coverage across multiple programming languages and project types.\n\n4. Metrics & reporting  \n- Security metrics:  \n  - Prompt injection success rate  \n  - Data leakage incidents (PII, secrets, proprietary code)  \n  - Malicious code suggestion rate  \n  - False positive/negative rates for attack detection  \n- Usability metrics:  \n  - Task completion time  \n  - Developer intervention frequency  \n- Reporting:  \n  - Aggregate results per task and attack vector  \n  - Detailed logs of LLM outputs and triggered vulnerabilities  \n  - Recommendations for mitigation based on observed weaknesses",
