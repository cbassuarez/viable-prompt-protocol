      "body": "1. Goals  \nThe primary goal is to empirically evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and security posture of a code-assistant LLM integrated within an IDE environment. The protocol aims to measure the assistant’s impact on developer productivity, code quality, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation or misuse.\n\n2. Threat model & attack surfaces  \n- Threat actors: Malicious users, compromised plugins, or external attackers with access to the IDE environment.  \n- Attack surfaces:  \n  - Prompt injection via user input or code comments  \n  - Manipulation of context windows (e.g., hidden code, misleading file structures)  \n  - Model output influencing insecure code patterns  \n  - Data leakage through model suggestions  \n- Assumptions: The IDE and LLM communicate over authenticated channels; the LLM has no persistent memory between sessions.\n\n3. Task suite design  \n- Code completion:  \n  - Insert code snippets with missing sections; measure accuracy and relevance of completions.  \n  - Include both standard library and third-party API usage.  \n- Refactoring:  \n  - Present legacy or “code smell” examples; assess the assistant’s ability to suggest and apply improvements.  \n- Explanation:  \n  - Request explanations for complex code blocks; evaluate clarity, correctness, and depth.  \n- Adversarial tasks:  \n  - Embed prompt injections and misleading comments; observe model behavior and resilience.  \n- Each task is performed in a controlled IDE environment with logging enabled.\n\n4. Metrics & reporting  \n- Accuracy: Percentage of correct or high-quality completions/refactorings as judged by expert reviewers.  \n- Security: Number and severity of successful adversarial manipulations or insecure suggestions.  \n- Productivity: Time-to-completion and error rates compared to baseline (no assistant).  \n- Usability: Qualitative feedback from participants on clarity, trust, and workflow integration.  \n- All results are reported with anonymized logs, summary statistics, and representative case studies.",
