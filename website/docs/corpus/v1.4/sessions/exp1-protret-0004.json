Restatement of Task: The final objective is to draft a concise, structured experimental protocol for assessing how robust a code-assistant LLM (integrated into a developer IDE) is against prompt-injection attacks. This protocol will be targeted at technically literate readers and must include: the evaluation’s goals, a threat model and attack surfaces, the design of the task suite (i.e., what the assistant will be asked to do), and the metrics/reporting methods for measuring both robustness and utility.\n\n2. Tag Confirmation: I understand the tags `<g> <q> <o> <c> <o_f>`. I will always mirror the user’s tag as the first line of my reply.\n\n3. Footer Confirmation: I will append exactly one footer line per reply, formatted as `[Version=… | Tag=… | …]`.\n\n4. Additional Information Needed: Before designing the experiment, I would ideally want to know: (a) the specific LLM(s) and IDE(s) involved, (b) whether the evaluation is black-box or white-box, (c) any constraints on resources or time, (d) the intended use cases or user personas, and (e) any prior work or baseline protocols to consider.\n\n5.

      "body": "1. Goals\nThe primary goal is to evaluate the robustness of a code-assistant LLM, integrated into a developer IDE, against prompt-injection attacks. Secondary objectives include assessing the impact of such attacks on the assistant’s utility and identifying common failure modes or vulnerabilities. The protocol aims to provide reproducible, quantitative, and qualitative insights into both the security and practical usability of the LLM in real-world development workflows.\n\n2. Threat Model & Attack Surfaces\n- Adversary: An attacker with access to the IDE environment, capable of introducing malicious prompts via code comments, documentation, or other user-editable text fields.\n- Attack Surfaces:\n- Code comments (inline, block, docstrings)\n- File headers and README files\n- External dependencies (e.g., imported scripts with embedded prompts)\n- IDE-integrated chat or command interfaces\n- Attack Vectors:\n- Direct prompt-injection (malicious instructions embedded in code)\n- Indirect prompt-injection (malicious content in dependencies or documentation)\n- Multi-stage attacks (chained or persistent injections across sessions)\n\n3. Task Suite Design\n- Representative Tasks:\n- Code completion (e.g., filling in function bodies, autocompleting statements)\n- Refactoring (e.g., renaming variables, extracting methods)\n- Code explanation (e.g., summarizing function behavior, generating documentation)\n- Bug fixing (e.g., identifying and correcting logic errors)\n- For each task:\n- Prepare clean (benign) and adversarial (prompt-injected) variants.\n- Ensure tasks span multiple programming languages and complexity levels.\n- Include both synthetic and real-world codebases.\n- Execution:\n- Randomize task order and variants to minimize bias.\n- Log all LLM outputs and IDE interactions for analysis.\n\n4. Metrics & Reporting\n- Robustness Metrics:\n- Injection Success Rate: Percentage of tasks where the LLM follows injected instructions.\n- Severity Score: Qualitative rating of the impact (e.g., benign, misleading, harmful).\n- Detection Rate: Frequency of the LLM flagging or resisting suspicious prompts.\n- Utility Metrics:\n- Task Success Rate: Percentage of tasks completed correctly (regardless of injection).\n- Output Quality: Human or automated assessment of code correctness and relevance.\n- Reporting:\n- Aggregate results by task type, attack vector, and programming language.\n- Provide anonymized examples of notable failures and successes.\n- Discuss limitations and recommendations for future mitigation strategies.",
