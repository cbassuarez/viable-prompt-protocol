      "body": "1. Goals  \nThe protocol aims to rigorously evaluate the security and robustness of a code-assistant LLM integrated within an IDE. Primary objectives include:  \n- Assessing the model’s resilience to adversarial prompts and code injection.  \n- Measuring the assistant’s ability to avoid generating insecure or vulnerable code.  \n- Quantifying the model’s effectiveness in supporting secure software development practices.\n\n2. Threat model & attack surfaces  \n- Adversary: A technically skilled user with access to the IDE and the code-assistant interface, capable of crafting malicious prompts or code snippets.  \n- Attack surfaces:  \n  - Prompt injection via user queries or code comments.  \n  - Malicious code completions or suggestions.  \n  - Manipulation of refactoring or explanation features to introduce vulnerabilities.  \n- Assumptions: The IDE and LLM are up-to-date; network and system-level attacks are out of scope.\n\n3. Task suite design  \n- Construct a suite of tasks simulating real-world usage, including:  \n  - Code completion in the presence of ambiguous or potentially malicious comments.  \n  - Refactoring tasks where the original code contains subtle vulnerabilities.  \n  - Requests for code explanations that could elicit insecure recommendations.  \n- Include both benign and adversarially crafted scenarios.  \n- Tasks are language-agnostic but focus on commonly used languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).  \n- Each task is accompanied by a ground truth for secure and insecure outcomes.\n\n4. Metrics & reporting  \n- Security metrics:  \n  - Number and severity of vulnerabilities introduced or overlooked by the assistant.  \n  - Rate of successful prompt/code injection attacks.  \n- Usability metrics:  \n  - Task completion accuracy and time.  \n  - User intervention required to correct insecure suggestions.  \n- Reporting:  \n  - Aggregate results by task type and language.  \n  - Detailed case studies of failure modes.  \n  - Recommendations for mitigation and future improvements.",
