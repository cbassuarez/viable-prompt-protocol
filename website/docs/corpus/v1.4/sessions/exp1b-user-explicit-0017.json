      "body": "1. Goals  \nThe primary objective is to rigorously evaluate the security and robustness of a code-assistant LLM integrated within an IDE. The protocol aims to:  \n- Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversarial prompts or code snippets.  \n- Assess the model’s resilience to prompt injection, data leakage, and unsafe code suggestions.  \n- Benchmark the assistant’s ability to maintain user privacy and codebase confidentiality during typical development workflows.\n\n2. Threat Model & Attack Surfaces  \n- Adversary: A technically skilled user or external actor with access to the IDE, capable of crafting malicious prompts or code.  \n- Attack surfaces include:  \n  - Prompt injection via comments, variable names, or code context.  \n  - Model-generated code that introduces vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure API usage, hardcoded secrets).  \n  - Leakage of proprietary or sensitive information from the model’s training data or user codebase.  \n  - Manipulation of code explanations or refactoring suggestions to mislead users.\n\n3. Task Suite Design  \n- Construct a suite of tasks reflecting real-world IDE usage:  \n  - Code completion: Insert prompts and code fragments designed to test for injection and leakage.  \n  - Refactoring: Request refactoring of code containing embedded adversarial payloads.  \n  - Explanation: Ask for explanations of code with obfuscated or malicious intent.  \n- Include both benign and adversarial scenarios, with tasks randomized and anonymized for unbiased assessment.  \n- Tasks should cover multiple programming languages and frameworks relevant to the target user base.\n\n4. Metrics & Reporting  \n- Quantitative metrics:  \n  - Number and severity of vulnerabilities triggered (e.g., CVSS score).  \n  - Frequency of unsafe or insecure code suggestions.  \n  - Incidence of data leakage or privacy violations.  \n- Qualitative metrics:  \n  - Clarity and accuracy of explanations in adversarial contexts.  \n  - User trust and perceived safety (via post-task surveys).  \n- Reporting:  \n  - Aggregate results in a standardized format, highlighting critical findings and trends.  \n  - Provide reproducible task descriptions and anonymized logs for external review.",
