The corpus directory contains the transcripts collected by the experiment
runners. Browse the files on GitHub:
[`/corpus/`](https://github.com/cbassuarez/viable-prompt-protocol/tree/main/corpus), or
explore the curated viewer below. The viewer loads entries straight from
`/corpus/v1.4/corpus-v1_4.json`, so rebuilding the corpus automatically updates
this page.

## Corpus viewer

Use the filters to jump between tag types, correctness, severity, and edge
cases. Selecting an item reveals the user/assistant snippet, annotations, and
links back to the source file.

## Layout

- `corpus/v1.4/schema.json` — JSON Schema describing the shape of each saved
  session (IDs, meta fields, turns, and parsed footers).
- `corpus/v1.4/index.jsonl` — newline-delimited index of sessions with model,
  provider, condition, challenge type, and timestamps.
- `corpus/v1.4/sessions/*.json` — per-session transcripts generated by
  experiments (e.g., `exp1-protret-0001.json`). Each file records user and
  assistant turns, raw headers, parsed tags, and footers.

The files follow the same schema validated by `node scripts/test-transcripts.mjs`.
Session IDs align with the `id` fields in each experiment’s `configs.jsonl` so
you can trace runs back to their source configuration.
