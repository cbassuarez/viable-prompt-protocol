title: 'Corpus'

The VPP corpus curates transcripts, logs, and supporting artifacts that illustrate the protocol in action.
It is organized by experiment series, exploratory runs, and failure investigations, all stored in the repository under the
[`/corpus/`](https://github.com/cbassuarez/viable-prompt-protocol/tree/main/corpus) directory.

- **Experiment bundles** — Canonical datasets associated with Exp-01, Exp-02, and Exp-01b.
- **User-only sessions** — Explorations where operators apply VPP without assistant output for onboarding or rehearsal.
- **Failure cases** — Logs highlighting edge conditions, protocol breaks, and corrective strategies.
- **Artifacts** — Header snippets, prompt templates, and evaluation forms referenced across the spec.

Large transcripts remain in GitHub for archival fidelity.
This page serves as the conceptual map, pointing readers to the right folders and describing what to expect within each
subdirectory.
