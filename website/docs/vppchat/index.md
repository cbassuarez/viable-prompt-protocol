VPPChat ships the protocol with defaults that match the normative spec. Use this quickstart to get oriented.

1. Install the TestFlight build and sign in.
2. Start a new conversation and keep the header snippet in view.
3. Use the on-screen controls to send `!<g>`, `!<q>`, or `!<o>` and review the compliance footer on every reply.
4. When ready to ship, close the loop with `!<o_f>`.

Release updates, privacy notes, and the roadmap live alongside this quickstart.
