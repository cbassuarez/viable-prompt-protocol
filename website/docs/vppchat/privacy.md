[Join VPPChat Beta (TestFlight)](https://testflight.apple.com/join/EXAMPLE)

VPPChat honors the protocol's transparency requirements while keeping beta telemetry minimal.

- Conversations are scoped to your device and session unless explicitly shared.
- TestFlight crash and performance logs are used to debug stability only.
- Protocol headers and footers remain visible so you can audit what is sent.

For removal requests or questions, use the TestFlight feedback channel and reference the build version.
