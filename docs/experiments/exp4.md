# Exp4 — Task Utility

Exp4 compares Viable Prompt Protocol (VPP) against a baseline and a minimal competitor protocol on realistic technical tasks. Each config pairs a task from `experiments/exp4-task-utility/tasks.json` with one of the three conditions and logs a single assistant response.

## Running
