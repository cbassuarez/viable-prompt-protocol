# Exp5 — Friction & Convergence

Exp5 simulates iterative conversations to see how many turns each protocol needs before satisfying explicit structural constraints. The runner reuses tasks from Exp4 with deterministic validators and records convergence metrics per session.

## Running

```
npm run run:exp5-friction
npm run analyze:exp5
```
