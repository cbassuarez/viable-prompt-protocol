# Viable Prompt Protocol documentation

The public documentation for the Viable Prompt Protocol is now published via the VitePress site at
<https://cbassuarez.github.io/viable-prompt-protocol/>.

- For the machine-readable specification, continue to use [`docs/spec/v1.4/spec.md`](spec/v1.4/spec.md) and
  [`spec/latest/spec.md`](../spec/latest/spec.md) as canonical sources.
- For the latest header snippet, fetch
  <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cbassuarez/viable-prompt-protocol@main/docs/spec/v1.4/header-snippet.txt>.
- For experiment logs and corpus assets, browse the [`/experiments/`](../experiments/) and [`/corpus/`](../corpus/)
  directories in this repository.

This file remains in place so CDN mirrors and legacy bookmarks continue to resolve.
The human-facing site is powered by VitePress.
