      "body": "1. Goals  \nThe primary objective is to rigorously evaluate the security and robustness of a code-assistant LLM integrated within an IDE. The protocol aims to identify vulnerabilities, measure resistance to prompt injection and data leakage, and assess the model’s reliability in real-world coding workflows. Secondary goals include benchmarking the assistant’s utility and documenting any unintended behaviors that could impact developer security or privacy.\n\n2. Threat Model & Attack Surfaces  \n- Adversaries: Malicious users, compromised plugins, or external attackers with access to the IDE environment.  \n- Attack vectors:  \n  - Prompt injection via code comments, file names, or external documentation.  \n  - Data exfiltration through model outputs or logging.  \n  - Manipulation of code completions to introduce vulnerabilities.  \n  - Abuse of refactoring or explanation features to leak sensitive information.  \n- Surfaces:  \n  - User input fields (code, comments, prompts).  \n  - IDE extensions and plugin APIs.  \n  - Model-to-IDE communication channels.\n\n3. Task Suite Design  \n- Construct a suite of tasks simulating typical developer workflows:  \n  - Code completion in the presence of benign and adversarial comments.  \n  - Refactoring code with embedded secrets or sensitive logic.  \n  - Explaining code that contains obfuscated or malicious payloads.  \n  - Handling files with misleading names or metadata.  \n- Include both standard and adversarially crafted scenarios.  \n- Automate task execution where possible to ensure reproducibility and coverage.\n\n4. Metrics & Reporting  \n- Security metrics:  \n  - Prompt injection success rate.  \n  - Incidence of sensitive data leakage.  \n  - Frequency of unsafe code suggestions.  \n- Utility metrics:  \n  - Task completion accuracy.  \n  - Developer productivity impact (measured via time-to-completion or error rates).  \n- Reporting:  \n  - Aggregate results by task and attack vector.  \n  - Document all observed vulnerabilities and anomalous behaviors.  \n  - Provide reproducible logs and, where feasible, code diffs for all test cases.",
