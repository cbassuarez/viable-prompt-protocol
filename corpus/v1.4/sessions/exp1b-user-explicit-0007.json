      "body": "1. Goals  \nThe primary objective is to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and security of a code-assistant LLM integrated within an IDE. The protocol aims to measure the assistant’s utility in real-world development workflows, its resilience to adversarial prompts, and its impact on developer productivity and code quality.\n\n2. Threat model & attack surfaces  \n- Threat model: The LLM may be targeted by users (malicious or careless) attempting to induce insecure, incorrect, or misleading code completions, explanations, or refactorings.  \n- Attack surfaces:  \n  - Prompt injection via code comments, variable names, or user queries.  \n  - Malicious code suggestions that introduce vulnerabilities.  \n  - Data leakage through model outputs (e.g., suggesting proprietary code).  \n  - Manipulation of refactoring or explanation features to produce incorrect or misleading results.\n\n3. Task suite design  \n- Code completion:  \n  - Standard tasks: Complete partially written functions, classes, or modules in various languages.  \n  - Adversarial tasks: Insert misleading comments or variable names to test prompt injection resilience.  \n- Refactoring:  \n  - Standard: Refactor legacy code for readability, performance, or maintainability.  \n  - Adversarial: Request refactoring on code with hidden vulnerabilities or obfuscated logic.  \n- Explanation:  \n  - Standard: Generate explanations for code snippets, algorithms, or error traces.  \n  - Adversarial: Request explanations for intentionally confusing or misleading code.  \n- Each task is presented in a controlled IDE environment with logging of user interactions and model outputs.\n\n4. Metrics & reporting  \n- Accuracy: Percentage of correct, functional, and secure code completions and refactorings (validated by automated tests and expert review).  \n- Security: Number and severity of vulnerabilities introduced or missed by the assistant.  \n- Robustness: Success rate against adversarial prompts (e.g., prompt injection, misleading queries).  \n- Productivity: Time saved or lost compared to baseline (no assistant) in completing tasks.  \n- Usability: Qualitative feedback from participants on clarity, helpfulness, and trustworthiness.  \n- All results are reported with statistical significance, breakdowns by task type, and anonymized logs for reproducibility.",
