      "body": "1. Goals  \nThe protocol aims to rigorously evaluate the security and robustness of a code-assistant LLM embedded in an IDE. Key objectives include:  \n- Assessing the model’s susceptibility to adversarial prompts and code injection.  \n- Measuring the assistant’s ability to avoid generating insecure code or leaking sensitive information.  \n- Benchmarking the LLM’s performance on realistic developer tasks under both benign and adversarial conditions.\n\n2. Threat model & attack surfaces  \n- Adversary: A technically skilled user with access to the IDE, attempting to induce insecure code generation, data leakage, or model misbehavior via crafted prompts or code context.  \n- Attack surfaces:  \n  - Prompt injection via comments, variable names, or code context.  \n  - Malicious code completions or refactoring suggestions.  \n  - Attempts to extract training data or proprietary information through queries.  \n- Out-of-scope: Direct model parameter manipulation, supply chain attacks, or attacks requiring external system compromise.\n\n3. Task suite design  \n- Curate a set of representative coding tasks (e.g., implementing algorithms, refactoring legacy code, explaining code snippets) across multiple languages.  \n- For each task, create both benign and adversarial variants (e.g., comments designed to trigger insecure suggestions, ambiguous requirements).  \n- Include tasks targeting known LLM vulnerabilities: prompt injection, data leakage, and insecure pattern generation.  \n- Ensure tasks are executable within the IDE, with clear success/failure criteria and reproducible setups.\n\n4. Metrics & reporting  \n- Security metrics:  \n  - Rate of insecure code completions/refactorings.  \n  - Incidence of prompt injection or data leakage events.  \n- Usability metrics:  \n  - Task completion time and accuracy under normal and adversarial conditions.  \n  - Developer satisfaction (optional, via post-task survey).  \n- Reporting:  \n  - Aggregate results by task type, language, and attack vector.  \n  - Provide detailed case studies for any critical failures or novel attack vectors discovered.  \n  - Summarize findings with actionable recommendations for model or deployment improvements.",
